\section{Leveraging a Velvet Fork}

In our work, we are addressing a hard fork; the interlink structure is stored
in the block header of each block, which affects the consensus protocol.
History shows that a hard fork or a soft fork is improbable to be adopted by
the Bitcoin community. However, a velvet fork can also serve the purposes of
our client by utilizing part of the auxiliary bytes of the coinbase
transaction. As a result, our proposed client can be used without the need of
adjusting the size of block headers; in fact, recent
work~\cite{velvet-nipopows} shows that the addition of a Merkle Mountain Range
root in the information of each block is sufficient to ensure provably secure
structural correctness of the proof under a velvet fork.

Naturally, the processing of this information will result in increased gas usage
due to additional on-chain computations that are needed for the verification of
the MMR root. However, since the verification of proofs is constant to the size
of the blocks under the optimistic scheme we adopt, the added cost will also be
constant. We thus claim that our client remains efficient under a velvet fork
as the gas usage will only be increased by a constant factor.
